Welcome to my website! ðŸŽ‰ I am Taekjun Kim, a computational neuroscientist at the University of Washington and the Washington National Primate Research Center. I study how neural circuits in the brain process sensory information from the environment and guide appropriate behaviors. Specifically, my research focuses on understanding the neural mechanisms that enable visual object recognition and scene perception in the ventral visual pathway of macaque monkeys.

My work combines neurophysiology experiments, behavioral studies, and computational modeling. I use advanced techniques like high-density electrophysiology and Ca++ imaging to record neural activity across multiple brain regions. By integrating experimental data with computational approaches, I seek to extract meaningful insights from the complex datasets.
