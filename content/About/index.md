### Research experience
> #### University of Washington, Washington National Primate Research Center
`Acting Assistant Professor` *(Jan 2023 – Present)*
- Investigating how the prefrontal cortex modulates feature selectivity in the visual cortex via inhibitory feedback
- Examining the functional architecture of brain areas in the ventral visual pathway using high-density electrophysiology and multi-photon Ca++ imaging in anesthetized macaques
- Exploring the neural mechanisms underlying visual crowding in behaving non-human primates
- Mentoring graduate students and post-docs in experimental design, data analysis, and programming (Matlab, Python)

`Acting Instructor` *(Oct 2019 – Jan 2023)*
- Investigated the neural mechanisms underlying visual crowding effects using electrophysiology, psychophysics, and convolutional neural networks (published in [J. Neurosci., 2024](/publications/JNeurosci_2024))
- Explored visual texture processing in the visual cortex with electrophysiology and machine learning, revealing that distinct texture sensations are linked to different temporal dynamics (published in [J. Neurosci., 2022](/publications/JNeurosci_2022))
- Authored two review papers on visual information processing in the ventral visual pathway (published in [Annu. Rev. Vis. Sci., 2020](/publications/AnnuRevVisSci_2020); [Curr. Opin. Neurobiol., 2019](/publications/CurrOpinNeurobiol_2019))
- Mentored graduate students and research assistants on experimental design, data analysis (object segmentation, global motion processing), and programming (Matlab, Python)

`Senior Fellow` *(Oct 2015 – Sep 2019)*
- Devised metrics to quantify the perceptual qualities of natural texture images
- Studied how object shape and texture properties are jointly processed in the visual cortex using electrophysiology / computational
modeling, finding that there are separate specializations in mid-level cortical processing for visual attributes of shape and texture
(published in [J. Neurosci., 2019](/publications/JNeurosci_2019))
- Advised and collaborated on a research project investigating neural correlates of global motion processing in the non-human primate
visual cortex (published in [Curr. Biol., 2023](/publications/CurrBio_2023))

> #### University of California, Berkeley
`Assistant Specialist` *(Jan 2015 – Sep 2015)*
- Designed a human psychophysics experiment to demonstrate that binocular integration can occur during substantial differences in left
and right eye signal strength. Wrote Matlab / Python code for visual stimulus generation, data acquisition, and analysis (published in [Eur. J.
Neurosci., 2017](publications/EJN_2017))

`Graduate Student Researcher` *(Aug 2010 – Dec 2014)*
- Analyzed a database of cortical neurons to determine the degree of non-linearity of direction selectivity for cells within different laminae
of the visual cortex (published in [Eur. J. Neurosci., 2016](publications/EJN_2016))
- Investigated the effects of non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on functional tuning properties of visual cortical neurons
(published in [Brain Stimul., 2015](publications/BrainStimul_2015))
- Conducted neurophysiological experiments to reveal segregated activity of feedforward, feedback, and horizontal pathways in visual
cortex (published in [Neuroscience, 2014](publications/Neurosci_2014))
- Led lab and discussion sessions for optometry students in Geometrical Optics class

> #### Seoul National University
`Research Associate` *(Sep 2008 – Jun 2010)*
- Studied the spatiotemporal selectivity of V1 response using Gabor stimuli that were sequentially presented with a variable stimulus onset
asynchrony. Wrote Matlab code for visual stimulus generation, data acquisition, and analysis (published in PLoS One, 2012; [PLoS One, 2015](publications/PLOS_one_2015))

`Graduate Student Researcher` *(Mar 2006 – Aug 2008)*
- Conducted a human psychophysics study to examine the spatial localization error in visual short-term memory task (published in KCBPA, 2014)
- Led lab and discussion sessions for psychology students in Neuroscience and Biopsychology classes
